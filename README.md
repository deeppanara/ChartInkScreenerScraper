# ChartInkScreenerScraper

This set of python scripts can be used to trade in shares in the indian stock exchanges.

It can place automated orders for stocks in cash and intraday,both buy and sell.

This can also be used to trade using short straddle strategy for banknifty.

Makes use of beautifulsoup to scrape the chartink website to automatically keep running the various screeners on the chartink dashboard and take trades
accordingly with out human intervention.

Would invite pythonistas and market enthusiasts to use this and also improve upon the programs.

Connect with me over mail to discuss and improve this further.

Few screenshots from the scripts developed using PySimpleGUI framework.![intraday_scrips](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31882456/232492108-de2f50f4-9256-48de-9761-f97a2a6e9717.png)
